# Virtual Box

## Laptop Version

This version is for building and running on a single node such as Laptops. It will be out a Virtual Box environment on any laptop or single workstation and then lay Epiphany down on that environment which allows for complete isolated running with no Internet connectivity.

The initial build will require Internet access to pull down the secure artifacts to build out the environment.
