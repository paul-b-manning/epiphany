# Simplified

This environment and its data.yaml will be created using following command:
```
./epiphany -a -b -i -f infrastructure/epiphany-playground -t infrastructure/epiphany-template
```

If you want to use simplified file you can use `-t` parameter with path to folder that contains `data.yaml.j2` template file. Using `-t` will cause data.yaml will be regenerated.
